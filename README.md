# Tensorflow Camp Project
This project is to suggest my idea for Tensorflow Camp in Korea on July 2017.
## Idea Suggestion
My idea is to develop a machine which can detect fake news using B.S Detection (Bull Shit Detection) Application. From parsing news texts, the machine can classify whether texts will be fake using machine learning. As long as I researched, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are preferrable architecture to make better performance. Therefore, using and testing these architecture, I am going to implement them and find out the best performance architecture. According to the paper, '“The Pope Has a New Baby!” Fake News Detection Using Deep Learning', by Samir Bajaj in CS224n, Stanford, this reports that Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) made 0.89 precision, 0.79 recall, and 0.84 F1 score. However, it will not satisfy to detect fake news at all. To tackle this result, I'm going to suggest better architecture for detecting fake news. I will use "Getting Real about Fake News" dataset from Kaggle as data source.
